# Gradient Background Generator

This is a simple web application that allows you to generate a gradient background for your website. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and consists of three files:

- index.html: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page, including the input fields for selecting the colors and the button for generating a random gradient.

- style.css: This file contains the styles for the web page, including the font, colors, and layout.

- script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that generates the gradient background based on the user's color selections.

To use the Gradient Background Generator, simply open the index.html file in your web browser and select the colors you want to use for your gradient. You can also click the "Random Colors" button to generate a random gradient. Or, [click here](https://omar-elhorbity.github.io/gradient-background/)
